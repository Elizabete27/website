        <h2>Music & Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            Eilish has scored several hits since she burst onto the music scene in 2015 with her debut single “Ocean Eyes.” The singer has had an impressive 44 songs make it into the Billboard Hot 100, including seven songs in the top 10. Her first and only No. 1 hit is the 2019 single “Bad Guy,” which delivered two of her first few Grammy Awards. The Grammy-winning “Everything I Wanted” cracked the Hot 100’s top 10 that same year, and in 2020, “Therefore I Am” came close to topping the chart, peaking at No. 2.

Beyond the charts, Eilish has also won several awards for her music, including nine Grammys, two Oscars, and two Golden Globes. The 2020 track “No Time To Die” won the artist her first Academy and Golden Globe awards, as well as another Grammy. This award trifecta was repeated again following the release of “What Was I Made For?,” which was written for the 2023 Barbie movie.

In 2024, Eilish released the top 10 singles “Birds of a Feather” and “Lunch” from her album Hit Me Hard and Soft. Some of her other hits include “Bury a Friend,” “My Future,” “Your Power,”“Happier Than Ever,” “Wildflower,” and “Guess” with Charli XCX.
